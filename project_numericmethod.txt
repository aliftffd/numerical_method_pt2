Scenario : 
in land-based radar systems, interface from reflected signals (multipath)
introduces nonlinear phase shifts that degrade received power. A kyy tas is to indentify angels /theta at which interfence is constructive/destructive 

1. root equation : solve and explain iteration steps 
2. Linear system : matrix form,solution methodm, interpretation 
3. curve fitting : model,fitting,plots, R^2 
4. create final report : Engineering insight + code appendix 

Computation Tasks

    Solve root equation for angle of destructive interference

    Solve linear system for antenna gains

    Fit a curve to received power vs angle dat
